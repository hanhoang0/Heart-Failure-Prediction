# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives
each year, amounting to 31% of all deaths worldwide. The United States alone ranked 4th in the world for
the number of death dues to heart disease. Unfortunately, with our medical knowledge and technological
advance, weâ€™re still unable to find a cure for coronary disease. The next best thing to do is configure models
that can accurately predict who is more likely to encounter coronary diseases, using three models (Multiple 
Regression, Decisions tree, and Random forest)
